# food-share-app
<b>Food Share application for iOS </b> is a part of my CS Bachelor's degree project.

The app is inspired by the <a href ="https://toogoodtogo.org/en/movement"> Too good to go </a> movement. The aim of this app is not only to demonstrate and enhance my software development skills, but also to make a step forward towards reducing food waste. 

The idea is to share food leftovers/excess amounts of products with short expiration dates with the community. Users will be able to put an offer at the specific location, specify the amount of money/goods they would expect for the item. Users interested in the offer would be able to contact the advertiser via chat. 

Application features will include the following:
<ul>
  <li> User authentication </li>
  <li> Offer search with filters </li>
  <li> Apple maps integration </li>
  <li> Chat </li>
  <li> Notifications (e.g. notifying that the buyer is ready to pick up the product)</li>
</ul>

Technologies:
<ul>
  <li> Swift </li>
  <li> MapKit Framework</li>
  <li> Firebase/Firestore </li>
</ul>


...to be continued
